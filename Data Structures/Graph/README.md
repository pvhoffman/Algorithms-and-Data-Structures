## Graph Data Structure

### About
A graph data structure is composed of edge connected vertices. The edges may be directed, i.e. one way, and/or weighted, i.e. implication of a per edge cost when traversing from one vertex to another. Graphs are representative of a great number of problems in computer science.

#### Reference Implementation Details
The reference implementation, declared and defined in graph.h, is comprised of several calles
